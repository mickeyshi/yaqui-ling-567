1.  Yes, you may share this with future students working on the AGGREGATION project.

2. We took the choice file and input it into the grammar matrix customizing engine. There were no significant causes of error, so the matrix was downloaded without modifying any of the choices. Once downloaded, the lexicon contained "%" characters that the lkb was unable to parse. These were replaced with the empty string. Additionally, within the VM, we needed to run "~/.bash_profile", which included the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable, to make sure that LD_LIBRARY_PATH was defined within the shell. Once this was done, we were able to use the program as expected.

3. For the provided grammar (before changes were made to the choices file: )
   *  2355 items parsed out of 2355.
   *  32.23 was the average number of parses per item. 
   *  672 readings were found for "uusi-tu-k in achai ayam nee ya'a-ria-k." [sentence 9500]
   * Yaqui has free word order, with an optional subject. We can highlight a few ambiguities that arise from this: 
      * SUBJ-HEAD and HEAD-COMP rules can both apply to an S. There are object markers that should resolve ambiguities in most cases, but Yaqui allows an optional subject. 
      * Grammar does not have a lexical entry corresponding to the coordination word "into"/"intok", and instead allows the creation of a CONJP from any two side-by-side NPs. 
      * Currently, the grammar doesn't carry over object-marker constraints to coordinated objects. (The marker -ta that should carry over to both conjuncts of a CONJP is not forced to appear on either argument, in our current grammar.)
      * The marker "in", corresponding to the determiner "my", is allowed to appear on either side of an NP that it serves as the determiner of. When it appears between two NPs, our as-is grammar states that it can be the daughter of either NP. This is because “in” is currently incorrectly labeled as an NP inside the lexicon.
     In actuality, these possessives should only occur at the start of an NP, and should replace any determiner. 
   * The ten sentences are as follows:
      * 11660. wo'i-m aamu . [Coyotes are hunting.] The semantics for the parse tree make sense: the wolf is assigned an index that corresponds to one of the arguments of hunt_rel, and hunt gets an index corresponding to the index of the sentence itself. An implied target of the hunt (in the non-focus ICONS value) is given as another argument in the hunt relation.
      * 11000. yee omta . [They didn't like us.] The semantics for the parse tree make sense: some people are assigned an exist_rel, and they serve as the argument for the hate_v_rel. The grammar at present doesn’t provide a way of associating the “us” portion of the translation with the people index, however - this might be a secondary meaning of “yee” not accounted for in the current lexicon. 
      * 11950. Koko bwan. [Well, they do die.] None of the semantics for this are correct - no “bwan” in the lexicon translates to “indeed.” Instead, the grammar treats this as an asyndetic conjunct of two VPs - one meaning “they die (pl.)”  and the other with “they cry”, or, alternatively, “koko” as an incorrectly-labeled NP. 
      * 12700. hapte=em ! [1. 'Stand up! (as when talking to a group of children)'; OR 2. 'Stop!' (as when telling children that have just stolen some oranges are running away)] There exists only one value in the rels list for this value, and it corresponds to the stand up/stop relation. The argument corresponding to the stander is underspecified, lacking the assumed existence relation of a listener that an imperative construction should provide. Essentially, the semantics represent a VP with an empty subject, rather than a command. 
      * 18380. inepo ku'una-k . [I (female)  got  married." (lit: I have  a  husband.)] These semantics are odd to an English-speaker but make sense. There exists some pronoun corresponding to I, “_pron_n_rel”, which is the arg1 of “_husband_v_rel”, roughly meaning “I was husbanded”, which translates to the literal meaning of the sentence above. There is also a non-focus arg2 which corresponds to the index of the overall sentence.
      * 21870. hippue . [You have it] Generally, these semantics make sense, but the arguments are empty; this has no details specified, leaving a lone "possess_v_rel" with effectively no content in arg0/arg1/arg2.
      * 21910. kaita ? [ Nothing?] Similarly to the above, this has no person or number implemented for arg0 and arg1, just "nothing_v_rel". Overall, though, these semantics still make sense because the notion of “nothing” is being expressed.
      * 21940. inepo ume tahkai-m avoh-vae . [I will serve the tortillas] The semantics corresponding to the 5th and 6th parses make sense. They are essentially stating that there exists someone (represented as a pronoun “_pron_n_rel”) x, and there exists a tortilla “_tortilla_n_rel” y such that x is offering food to y, represented by “offer.food_v_rel”.
      * 20650. hamut-m hi'ivoa [The women are cooking.] These semantics also make sense. They specify that there exists some woman “_woman_n_rel” such that the women are engaged in “_be cooking_v_rel”, which makes sense given the context. There is also a non-focus arg2, which has an index corresponding to the sentence itself.
      * 21990. huevena . [Many.] These semantics also generally make sense. Similar to previous one-word sentences, there is a central “_many_v_rel” relation with empty arg0/arg1 that contain no extra information. 
      * 22060. wakavaki-ta wiksime . [He was carrying some vegetable soup.] The semantics for this makes sense. The beef_stew_rel is given as the argument of the drag_v_rel, and the implied dragger/carrier is given an index corresponding to the non-focus RARG that appears as another argument of the drag relation. The drag argument has an index corresponding to the sentence itself. 
        
        
   After making changes to the grammar, our number of parses was as follows:
      * 2355 items parsed.
      * 29.49 was the average number of parses per item
      * 672 readings were found for “aurelia karmen-ta peo-ta uusi-m hiosia-ta vicha-ii’aa .” [sentence 16460]
      * With the exception of the small lexicon change to “in” (removing it from the set of nouns,) none of the same ambiguities from the previous run were addressed in the second iteration of the choices file and thus persist into this run. They are omitted for brevity. Note that we discuss some of the potential ambiguities that arise as a result of this grammar as it relates to case and possessives in section 5.
      * Since the semantics was not altered, we present the same examples as above for semantic analysis.

4. (and 5) We added two phenomena to our testsuite, possessives and case.
   1. Possessives
      1. In Yaqui, six adnominal possessives exist for the six permutations of person and number. “In”(1.sg), “em” (2.sg), “apo’ik” (3.sg), “itom” (1.pl), “enchim” (2.pl), and “vempo’im (3.pl), each going before the possessum they modify. I added in 6 sentences corresponding to the use of each of these possessives modifying the subject of an intransitive verb.

      Em kapitan nooka
      2SG.POSS captain speak
      Your captain is speaking.

      Additionally, the given choices file incorrectly marked the 1st person pronoun “in'' as an NP, leading to incorrect parses. This seems to have resulted from confusion with the other possessive: all possessives but the first and second person singulars are also the pronouns for their respective person and number. Consequently, for “in” and “em”, test cases were added to prohibit this.

      In nooka
      1SG.POSS speak
      My is speaking.

      Additional sentences were added as simplified versions of pre-existing sentences in the grammar doc. 

      To handle these sentences, the “in” NP was first removed from the lexicon. Then, the aforementioned six adnominal possessor pronouns were introduced to the grammar, occurring as separate words to the left of the possessum noun they act as specifiers for. Luckily, no possessor-possessum agreement was necessary. 

      Yaqui also has “aa”, a shortened version of the 3.sg possessive “apo’ik”. According to “An Introduction to Hiaki Grammar”, a suffix “-wa” is added to a possessum being modified by “aa”, before the “-ta” object marker in object nouns. The following sentence was added to the test suite to check this.

      Aa huuvi-wa wasau siika
      3SG.POSS wife-POSS went
      His wife went. 

      We don’t yet have the proper morphological tools to handle this affixation process, so no changes have yet been made to the morphology of our model to reflect this. 

   2. Case
      1. In Yaqui, the object is typically marked with a “-ta” suffix, and as such is considered to be in accusative case. 

      Source: Meheresh Yeditha
      Vetted: f
      Judgment: g
      Phenomena: {case}
      uu yo'o bwa'am-ta bwa'e
      uu yo'o bwa'am-ta bwa'e
      the adult.3sg broth-acc eat
      `The adult ate the broth.'

      This aspect was already included in the choices file, and so this parsing was expected. One aspect to note is that there was an ambiguity between noun-pc3_lrt1 and noun-pc2_lrt1; this was because both accepted “-ta” suffixes, and marked them as having different cases. To resolve this ambiguity for now, the choices file was amended to remove noun-pc3_lrt1 and retain noun-pc2_lrt1 since noun-pc2_lrt1 was annotated with case acc. 

      We note that the “-ta” suffix is not accepted on the subject (the nominative cased noun) and is not accepted on the verb, as seen in the following test case.

      Source: Meheresh Yeditha
      Vetted: f
      Judgment: u
      Phenomena: {case}
      uu yo'o bwa'am bwa'e-ta
      uu yo'o bwa'am bwa'e-ta
      the adult.3sg broth eat-acc
      `The adult ate the broth.'

      In the choices file, there was a verb class (verb-pc43) allowing “-ta” suffixes to attach to verbs, which caused the following example to parse. This was removed from the choices file, and thus this example no longer parses.

      In Yaqui, the “-ta” suffix is only applied when there is a transitive verb; for intransitive verbs this would be inappropriate.

      #Test case 8: pass
      Source: Meheresh Yeditha
      Vetted: f
      Judgment: g
      Phenomena: {case}
      uu yo'o hoote
      uu yo'o hoote
      the adult.3sg sit
      `The adult sits.'

      #Test case 9: fail

      Vetted: f
      Judgment: u
      Phenomena: {case}
      uu yo'o-ta hoote
      uu yo'o-ta hoote
      the adult.3sg-acc sit
      `The adult sits.'

      Finally, in Yaqui the object marker is omitted when the object is plural:

      #Test case 6: pass
      Source: Meheresh Yeditha
      Vetted: f
      Judgment: g
      Phenomena: {case}
      uu yo'o paloma-m bwa'e
      uu yo'o paloma-m bwa'e
      the adult.3sg pigeon-3pl.acc eat
      `The adult ate the pigeon.'

      #Test case 7: fail
      Source: Meheresh Yeditha
      Vetted: f
      Judgment: u
      Phenomena: {case}
      uu yo'o paloma-m-ta bwa'e
      uu yo'o paloma-m-ta bwa'e
      the adult.3sg pigeon-3pl-acc eat
      `The adult ate the pigeon.'

      This was amended in the choices file by specifying that noun-pc2_lrt1, which is the feature that accepts “-ta” suffixes and denotes them as having case acc, must have num sg. Therefore, we do not accept plural nouns that have “-ta” suffixes as denoted above.

6. As mentioned above, we don't yet have the proper morphological tools to handle the possessum-affixation process that adds “-wa” to the end of possessums that have “aa” as a possessor. 

   There is still a considerable amount of ambiguity when dealing with case. Since case markings are morphosyntactic in nature, this will be an area of potential improvement going forward. Additionally, it may be worth writing rules to govern which/how many nouns are allowed to have “-ta” suffixes. Though it is tempting to simply designate the noun immediately prior to the noun as the “object” and look for a “-ta” suffix given a SOV word order, Yaqui occasionally deviates from this word order, which can be seen in the test suite that was given to us.

7. While Hiaki indeed allows juxtaposition of both NPs and VPs, the current grammar allowing asyndetic and omnisyndetic patterns is causing an enormous amount of probably false data and ambiguity within fairly straightforward sentences - even a simply transitive sentence comes out with sixteen different interpretations.
