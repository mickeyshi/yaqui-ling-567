1. For the corpus, no changes were made - consult lab3 for coverage information for last week. 
For the revised testset (which had examples for both coordination and wh-questions added), 
	1. 62.9% coverage was attained (down from ~90% last week.)
	2. Average number of parses for parse item is 4.23.
	3. 50 was the max number of parses, for "Emilion bwiika Maria intok nooka"
	4. No real sources of ambiguity were added for the new questions, as most of them didn't parse (including all the wh-word questions.) "The usual suspects" of asyndetic coordination and omnisyndetic coordination created ambiguity in sentences with many conjunctive "nooka"s, like the ones that were added to test coordination. Verbs being identified with multiple verb classes in the lexicon continues to create ambiguity.  "Bwiika" being both a noun and verb causes a significant amount of ambiguity.
	5. For the new sentences that did parse (all wh-sentences did not parse):
		-"Emilio intok Maria intok nooka" - [Emilio and Maria and read] This should be ungrammatical, but our current syntax shows omnisyndetic coordination between the two proper nouns. Rest of the semantics are correct, assigning the conjunct to the speak_v_rel argument. 
		-"Peo toro-ta hinu into nenka" - The semantics of this parsed, ungrammatical sentence actually reflect the intended semantics of the next sentence: assigning both Peo and the bull's indices to the buy and sell relations.
		-"Peo toro-ta hinu into toro-ta nenka" - The semantics here are mostly correct, assigning Peo's index to the arguments of the buy and sell relations. The translation (and the original paper that the translation is taking  is actually trying to coindex the two instances of "toro-ta" [translating "Peter buys and sells the bull"], but there is no way for our grammar to make that connection at present. 
		-"Emilio kari-po intok waalupe-po tekipanoa" - This doesn't parse, due to the locative case not being handled correctly by verb classes on our grammar. Something like "Emilio kari-po tekipanoa" doesn't parse - we should fix this by making locative markers adverbial in nature.

Wh-words

The Introduction to Hiaki Grammar served as reference for adding words corresponding to what ("hiita"), who ("havee"), when ("haksa"/"hakun-sa"), and where ("hakwo", "hakwo-sa"). 

"Hiita" is fairly simple. It is always fronted, except when there is a sentential modifier at the start of a sentence. We can see in the following examples that it can replace both the subject and the object.

 For "havee" (who), the grammar states that it appears at the start of a sentence if it replaces a subject, or remains in situ if it replaces an object. If it replaces an object, it shortens its final vowel and gets the object marker "-ta", forming "haveta". Unfortunately, I was unable to find whether wh-fronting occurs in embedded clauses, and my source was unable to give a verdict one way or the other.

"Havee" can also replace both the subject and object in a sentence. We still have to enforce the accusative marker on "have-ta", however.

For wh-words "hakwo", "hakwosa", "hakunsa", and "haksa", the wh-words are fronted. Introduction to Hiaki Grammar claims that "hakwo" and "hakwosa" are interchangeable, as are "hakunsa" and "haksa". However, the IGT in the test corpus demarcates the "-sa" affix as a QUESTION affix, which is the interpretation we go with for our test suite. These wh-modifiers seem to take the form of adverbial modifiers at the start of the sentence.

For coordination, a few examples were added over last week:

According to Yaqui Coordination, by Martinez Fabian, locative nouns can be coordinated:

And while Yaqui allows the coordination of verb phrases,

We also allow the coordination of sentences with the "intok" in secondary position, like Latin. I'm not sure how this would be handled in the Grammar Matrix, however - likely will have to wait for .tdl editing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Revisions to the grammar: Trying to track down instances of "livrom" in the corpus made me realize that "livrom", which I had assumed to be singular, is actually plural. (It was missing the dash indicating an affix, which all other plural verbs had.) Consequently, I suspect examples like

Maria uka livrom-ta nooka
Maria the.SG.OBJ book-ACC read
Maria is reading the book. 

should actually be 

Maria uka livro-ta nooka
Maria the.SG.OBJ book-ACC read
Maria is reading the book. 

"livro" appears to just be a rare word in the lexicon (only appearing once in the corpus.) 

Because this is such a rare word with unspecified morphology (in the resource we're given, "livro" doesn't appear in the glossary, while "livrom" does, so it might be an exclusively plural phrase), I've decided to change the examples using the sentence template 

Maria ... livrom... nooka

from last week. 

All sentences that used this prior template now have the structure

Maria.... usi... vicha.
[Maria saw the child(ren).]

E.g.

Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {det}
Maria uka uusita vicha.
Maria uka uusi-ta vicha
Maria the.SG.OBJ child-ACC see
Maria sees the child. 


#Plural in object position

Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {det}

Maria the.PL.OBJ child-PL see
Maria sees the children.  


3.

Miscellaneous changes (unrelated to the phenomena being observed this week, just related to some of the cleanup):
Removed verb53 from the morphology. This verb class consisted of nouns being misinterpreted as verb predicates (in copula sentences, most likely.), like "hoara" [home], "uusi" [child], etc. 

Removed omnisyndetic coordination strategies for VPs and NPs from the choices file under the "Coordination" page. "Yaqui Coordination" paper by Cristiano Martinez Fabian specifies that omnisyndetic coordination is impossible, and that constructions like:

Emilio intok Maria intok nooka
Emilio and Maria and speak
Intended: Emilio and Maria are speaking.

should be ungrammatical in Hiaki. 

Added polysyndeton sentence coordination  under the "Coordination" page. I think it might be possible to coordinate sentences asyndetically, but this would introduce a lot of ambiguity into the parses, with Hiaki's pro-drop nature. 

None of these changes were able to actually be tested, as the Grammar Matrix went down before I was able to actually test the changes. However, I've included the new test choices file underneath choices-1-26-new in the root directory.

4. Due to the Grammar Matrix being down, while I actually added wh-questions to the choices file, I was unable to download the actual .tdl files from the Grammar Matrix website.

5. The automatically generated grammar doesn't seem to account for any of the wh-words. I was expecting to find one or two in the lexicon file (maybe identified as nouns?) but no wh-word of the ones given above were listed. Not sure whether this was an oversight or a conscious choice, to make the user specify any wh-words and avoid confusion.
