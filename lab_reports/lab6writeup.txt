Lab 6 Report

====================================================================================

1. For the semi.vpm file, made few changes:
	-Removed PNG from the start of the right-hand side rules, and changed the PER values to match the right-hand values in the semi.vpm of /grammars/eng 
	
		PNG.PER : PER
		  3rd <> third
		  2nd <> second
		  1st <> first
		  * <> *

		PNG.NUM : NUM
		  sg <> sg
		  pl <> pl
		  * <> *

		PNG.GEND : GEND
		  * <> *

	-Changed E.TENSE on right-hand side to TENSE, as per lab instructions. Changed the TENSE values on the right hand side to match the full names of the tenses, as seen in /grammars/eng semi.vpm. Added present tense "prs", mapping to "present". 
	-Since aspect is not specified on all nouns, added new aspect to "Tenses, Aspect, Mood" under Grammar Matrix:
			-no-aspect
			Added the following to the semi.vpm file:
			
			* <> *
			* >> no-aspect
			no-aspect << [e]
			
			Made the indicative mood default, to not generate constructions with subjunctive/quotative/other irrealis affixes:
			* >> ind
			ind << [e]
	Note that aspects were added in the "Tense, Aspect, Mood" section below. These were automatically added via the Grammar Matrix. The same goes for moods that were added. 
	
	Full list:
	E.TENSE : TENSE
	  pst <> past
	  fut <> future
	  prs <> present
	  * <> *
	E.ASPECT : ASPECT
	  prog <> prog
	  pfv <> pfv
	  cmpl <> cmpl
	  incep <> incep
	  ipfv <> ipfv
	  rel <> rel
	  hab <> hab
	  prosp <> prosp
	  * >> no-aspect
	  no-aspect << [e]
	E.MOOD : MOOD
	  ind <> ind
	  irr <> irr
	  imp <> imp
	  sbjv <> sbjv
	  directive <> directive
	  desid <> desid
	  quot <> quot
	  ev <> ev
	  * >> ind
	  ind << [e]
				
	These changes, combined with other changes made to the grammar (including adding features to affixes), reduced the number of translations of the first English sentence ("Dogs sleep") to 4, from 96 generated lines total prior to the changes. 
		The final 4 lines are:
			Chuu'u-m koche
			Chuu'u-m koche-o
			Chuu'u-m koche-ka
			Chuu'u-m koche-ka-o
			
		The same sentences arise if we translate from yaq to yaq. 

		The grammar still seems to be overgenerating on a few affixes: these will be fixed next week, when I get more information on the -o 'when' affix and the "-ka" ppl affix. The grammar also has trouble generating for the other sentences, but I'll assume those will also get worked on later. 
		
====================================================================================

2. 

No .tdl changes were made - sticking to the Grammar Matrix while I still can for the verb/auxiliary/adjective changes.   
 
-Case
	-Added COM and DIR case to the case list specifically for "-mak" and "-u" affixes, which weren't contributing any features in Morphology. Also added "SUPE" case for "-t", which had been classified as an auxiliary but is actually an affix meaning "on" or "about". 
-Tense, Aspect, Mood
	-Important: Added "prs" present affix. This is automatically assigned to verbs that do not get the past imperfect, past perfect, or future affixes, and was important in getting our translations to be more accurate. 
	-Removed the hilariously-named "pot" aspect (noun "soto'i" had been misinterpreted as an aspect, for some reason)
	-Added "HAB" aspect for habitual aspect (required for red3- affix on certain verbs.)
	-Added no-aspect aspect for default aspect
	-Added "prog" aspect for progressive aspect (required for red2- PROG affix).
		-Made it a subtype of imperfective. 
	-Added DESID mood, for desiderative affix. 
	-Added ev mood, for evidentials. 
-Lexicon

THE BIG VERB CLEANUP--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intro to Hiaki Grammar identifies only two distinctions between nouns: transitive vs. intransitive. Most of the complexity of Hiaki verbs comes with the affixes, so it made sense to me to make the verb classes as simple as possible. I wanted to do a simple divide of the verb classes into general transitive and intransitive classes:

  verb6_name=transitive-verb
    verb6_feat1_name=case
    verb6_feat1_value=nom
    verb6_feat1_head=subj
    verb6_feat2_name=case
    verb6_feat2_value=acc
    verb6_feat2_head=obj
  verb6_valence=nom-acc
  
  verb68_name=intransitive-verb
    verb68_feat1_name=case
    verb68_feat1_value=nom
    verb68_feat1_head=subj
  verb68_valence=nom

I've omitted the all choices file stuff here in favor of brevity, but only the two example lines below are changed per entry:
    verb225_stem1_orth=siika
    verb225_stem1_pred=_go_v_rel
	
Certain nouns in a copula construction were being misidentified as nouns. Moved these to common-noun noun class, if they weren't already there. 
	Verb class		Spelling		Translation		Notes
	verb4			chuu'u			dog				Removed verb4
	verb4			hiaki			hiaki	
	verb4			kapinteo		carpenter
	verb4			kovanao			governer
	verb4			secretario		secretary
	verb4			kaita			nothing
	verb4			peeso			dollar
	
	
Certain adjectives were being misidentified as verbs. Created new adjective predicate class basic-adjective (class details given below), and added the following verbs to it:

	Verb class			Spelling		Translation		Notes
	verb195 (removed)	uku				tempting		Removed verb class, adj was only member of class
	verb4				veinte			twenty
	verb218				tapsisiolai		thin
	verb4				o'ola			old
	verb4				nawa			together
	verb4				patti			covered
	verb43				yo'ori			respected
	verb46				tu'if			good
	verb220				yoo				old(animate)
	verb218				huevena			many
	
	
Removed verb41. This consisted only of the verb "soa", only appearing in the following sentence. Moved the verb "soa" to transitive-verb class. 
	16410@@@@-1@@hunuen hi-soa@@@@1@2@thus "THING"-poke // They are killing with that.@@
	Note: I believe "hi" in this sentence is a shortened version of "hita" [something], which is why I think it's a transitive sentence. The gloss is confusing here, though.  
	
Removed verb234. This consisted only of the verb "yoa~". "Yoa" [shake] already appears as a transitive verb, and I was unable to locate this tilde'd version anywhere in the corpus. 

Moved certain verbs to intransitive:
Verbs were double-checked against the Hiaki-English dictionary and the corpus to determine transitivity. Because of Hiaki's pro-drop nature, it was occasionally difficult to determine whether an argument was simply being left out (i.e. "asoa" - "give birth" - only ever occurs in intransitive environments, but it's possible that there could be an uninstantiated object argument.)

	Verb class			Spelling		Translation		Notes
	verb233				yo'otu			grow			Removed verb class entirely, was only member of class
	verb192				tu'iria			get well		Removed verb class entirely, was only member of class
	verb69				machukta		be in the hand?	
	verb105				naamuke			get drunk		Verb class had '-o' "when" relativizer affix
	verb69				bwichia			smoke
	verb105				to'ote			lie down
	verb156				koche			sleep
	verb156				yeewe			play
	verb218				sipa			cool down
	verb46				yoa~			shake
	verb46				asoa			give birth
	
The following IGT should be ungrammatical:
John Maria-ta yo'otu
John Maria-ACC to.grow
Intended: "John Maria grows."
	
Moved certain verb to transitive:
	Verb class			Spelling		Translation		Notes
	verb94				mahti			teach			Removed verb class entirely, was only member of class
	verb29				eta				close			Removed verb class entirely, was only member of class
	verb105				vepsu			whip			
	verb194				tutta			insert
	verb159				rettrato		take picture
	verb46				hiohte			write			
	verb218				huuve			get married		Note: The IGT for santos into maria emo = huuve-k has the literal translation "Santos and Maria married each other".
	verb218				komonia			soak
	verb218				maveta			accept
	verb218				tetemu			kick	
	verb46				tu'ute			repair/clean
	verb46				vaita'a			fool
	verb220				yeuwa			play with
	verb220				yo'ore			respect
	verb220				yo'oturia		raise
	verb4				hinu			buy
	verb4				naake			care for
	verb4				teeka			lay it across
	verb4				kuuta			stir
	
Coalesced remaining verb classes (verb131, verb4, verb20) into verb6 - the general "transitive verb" category.

Chapter 10 of "Introduction to Hiaki Grammar" introduces a few irregular verbs that specify the number of their subject or object. Various verbs from other verb classes that had (sg. subj) or (pl. subj) in their rel values were moved into this new category, and the parenthesized part of the _rel value were removed. 

One class of intransitives specifies that their subject must be plural: 
 verb218_name=irr-intransitive-pl-subject-verb
    verb218_feat1_name=number
    verb218_feat1_value=pl
    verb218_feat1_head=subj
  verb218_valence=nom
    verb218_stem1_orth=watte
    verb218_stem1_pred=_fall_v_rel
    verb218_stem3_orth=tenne
    verb218_stem3_pred=_run_v_rel
    verb218_stem4_orth=rehte
    verb218_stem4_pred=_walk_v_rel
    verb218_stem5_orth=kaate
    verb218_stem5_pred=_go_v_rel
    verb218_stem7_orth=kiimu
    verb218_stem7_pred=_attack-or-enter_v_rel
    verb218_stem8_orth=yaaha
    verb218_stem8_pred=_arrive_v_rel
    verb218_stem9_orth=koko
    verb218_stem9_pred=_die_v_rel
    verb218_stem10_orth=hapte
    verb218_stem10_pred=_stand.up_v_rel
    verb218_stem11_orth=ha'abwek
    verb218_stem11_pred=_be.standing_v_rel
    verb218_stem12_orth=hooye
    verb218_stem12_pred=_sit.down_v_rel
    verb218_stem13_orth=hooka
    verb218_stem13_pred=_be.sitting.or.situated_v_rel
    verb218_stem14_orth=to'ote
    verb218_stem14_pred=_lie.down_v_rel
    verb218_stem15_orth=to'oka
    verb218_stem15_pred=_be.lying.down_v_rel
    verb218_stem16_orth=hoote
    verb218_stem16_pred=_get.up_v_rel

The following should parse:
Uusi-m tenne
Child-PL run
"Children are running."

But the following should not:
Uusi tenne
Child run
"A child is running."
	
Likewise, another class of intransitives specifies that their subject must be singular. These have the same rel values as the previous set, but different stems:
  verb220_name=irr-intransitive-sg-subject-verb
    verb220_feat1_name=number
    verb220_feat1_value=sg
    verb220_feat1_head=subj
  verb220_valence=nom
    verb220_stem1_orth=weye
    verb220_stem1_pred=_go (sg. subj.)-or-walk_v_rel
    verb220_stem2_orth=weche
    verb220_stem2_pred=_fall_v_rel
    verb220_stem3_orth=yepsa
    verb220_stem3_pred=_arrive_v_rel
    verb220_stem7_orth=muuke
    verb220_stem7_pred=_die_v_rel
    verb220_stem8_orth=weama
    verb220_stem8_pred=_walk_v_rel
    verb220_stem9_orth=kivake
    verb220_stem9_pred=_enter_v_rel
    verb220_stem10_orth=vuite
    verb220_stem10_pred=_run_v_rel
    verb220_stem11_orth=kikte
    verb220_stem11_pred=_stand.up_v_rel
    verb220_stem12_orth=weyek
    verb220_stem12_pred=_be.standing_v_rel
    verb220_stem13_orth=yeesa
    verb220_stem13_pred=_sit.down_v_rel
    verb220_stem14_orth=katek
    verb220_stem14_pred=_be.sitting.or.situated_v_rel
    verb220_stem15_orth=vo'ote
    verb220_stem15_pred=_lie.down_v_rel
    verb220_stem16_orth=vo'oka
    verb220_stem16_pred=_be.lying.down_v_rel
    verb220_stem17_orth=yehte
    verb220_stem17_pred=_get.up_v_rel

The following IGT should parse:
Uusi kikte
Child enter
"A child is entering."

But the following should not:
Uusi-m kikte
Child-PL enter
"Children are entering."

One class of transitives specifies that their object must be singular: 
  verb221_name=irr-transitive-sg-object-verb
    verb221_feat1_name=number
    verb221_feat1_value=sg
    verb221_feat1_head=obj
  verb221_valence=nom-acc
    verb221_stem1_orth=kecha
    verb221_stem1_pred=_erect_v_rel
    verb221_stem2_orth=yecha
    verb221_stem2_pred=_put_v_rel
    verb221_stem3_orth=kivacha
    verb221_stem3_pred=_bring.in_v_rel
    verb221_stem4_orth=me'a
    verb221_stem4_pred=_kill_v_rel
	
The following should parse:
Maria kari-ta kecha
Maria house-ACC erect
"Maria is erecting a house."

But the following should not:
Maria kari-m kecha
Maria house-PL erect
"Maria is erecting houses."

(The second does parse, but the actual "kecha" in the sentence is a separate "kecha" meaning "stop", rather than "erect.")
	
One class of transitives specifies that their object must be plural. These have the same stems as the irregular transitive subject verbs. 
  verb222_name=irr-transitive-pl-object-verb
    verb222_feat1_name=number
    verb222_feat1_value=pl
    verb222_feat1_head=obj
  verb222_valence=nom-acc
    verb222_stem1_orth=ha'abwa
    verb222_stem1_pred=_erect_v_rel
    verb222_stem2_orth=hoa
    verb222_stem2_pred=_put_v_rel
    verb222_stem3_orth=kiima
    verb222_stem3_pred=_bring.in_v_rel
    verb222_stem4_orth=sua
    verb222_stem4_pred=_kill_v_rel

The following should not parse:
Maria kari-ta ha'abwa
Maria house-ACC erect
"Maria is erecting a house."

But the following should:
Maria kari-m ha'abwa
Maria house-PL erect
"Maria is erecting houses."

	
A last set of categories consists of the verbs for go, which are specified for both tense and verb. These don't work quite yet, as the obligatory tense-marking lexical rule produces "siika-k" instead of the correct "siika". Cleanup for next week. 
  verb223_name=go-sg-pres-verb
    verb223_feat1_name=number
    verb223_feat1_value=sg
    verb223_feat1_head=subj
    verb223_feat2_name=tense
    verb223_feat2_value=prs
    verb223_feat2_head=verb
  verb223_valence=nom
    verb223_stem1_orth=siime
    verb223_stem1_pred=_go_v_rel
  verb224_name=go-pl-pres-verb

Auxiliary cleanup
Many auxiliaries were simply misidentified affixes. They had the same tense markers as affixes, but occurred independently of a verb, but with the initial hyphen still there. Removed these from the language. 

	-Removed aux18 auxiliary class from the lexicon. This was the perfective tense marker "-k", which is already handled via a lexical rule in the verb morphology. 	
	-Removed aux19 auxiliary class from the lexicon. This was the object marker "-ta", which is already handled via a noun lexical rule in the noun morphology. 
	-Removed aux20 auxiliary class from the lexicon. This was the sentence relativizer affix "-me", which a) isn't handled by the Grammar Matrix at present and b) shouldn't be an auxiliary at all.
	-Removed aux28 "-wa" from the auxiliary category. This corresponded to either a) marker on a possessum noun, which was already handled via a possessum lexical rule, or b) a passive verb tense that we are not implementing in the current Matrix.
	-Removed aux21 auxiliary class from the lexicon. This was the future passive verb affix "-na", which had been mistaken as an auxiliary. 
	-Removed aux22 auxiliary class from the lexicon. This was the future verb affix "-ne", which had been mistaken as an auxiliary. 
	-Moved "soto'i" [pot] from verbal auxiliary aux30 to common-noun noun class. Interpreter had perhaps misidentified noun "pot" as an affix? Removed aux30 auxiliary class. 
	-Removed aux23 auxiliary class. This was the 1pl reflexive noun "ito", which had probably been mistaken for an auxiliary by the inference system. 
	Removed aux16 auxiliary class. This was the auxiliary "-n", used for impf case, which had probably been mistaken for an auxiliary by the inference system.  
	Removed aux17 auxiliary class.  This was the auxiliary "-u", used for DIR case on nouns, which had probably been mistaken for an auxiliary by the inference system.  
	Removed aux24 aux class. This was the aux "-ka", used for ppl (past participle) case on nouns. 
	-Removed aux23 auxiliary class. This was the locative noun case marker "-po", which had been mistaken for an auxiliary by the inference system. 
	-Removed aux27 auxiliary class. This was the completive affix "-t", used to mark superessive case on nouns. This was not handled by noun lexical rule, but made it another lexical rule attached to nounpc-10 (post-object-marking noun position class)
	-Removed aux29 auxiliary class. This was the completive affix "-su", used to mark completive aspect on verbs. This was already handled via verb lexical rules
	
	WH-WORDS
	Moved "hakwo" and "hakwo-sa" [where] and "haksa" and "hakun-sa" [when] to the Adverb category. 
	Choices file:
		  adv5_name=where_question_adverb
			adv5_stem1_orth=hakwo

			adv6_stem2_pred=_time_a_rel
		  adv6_inter=on
		  adv6_type=loc
COPULAS--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	-Added empty copula framework for newly minted adjectives (just so adjectival predicate phrases have somewhere to go). Hiaki allows the formation of phrases like:
		Chuu’u si ovetu.
		Dog very lazy
		‘The dog is very lazy.'
	The choices file:
		cop1_name=empty-copula
		cop1_comptype=ap
	I don't know how to create an entry for an empty, so this category is bare for now, and the above IGT doesn't parse. TBD!

ADJECTIVES--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	-Added category for basic adjectives. Adjectives in Hiaki occur before the noun they modify, and can be used in copula constructions like "Chuu'u si ovetu". Moved misidentified verbs that were actually adjectival predicates to this category. They can also be used to just modify the noun they precede, like:
		Ume ili uusi-m nooka
		The little children speak
		"The little children speak.
	Choices file:
		  adj1_name=basic_adjective
		  adj1_mod=both
		  adj1_modpos=before
		  adj1_predcop=obl
			adj1_stem1_orth=uku
			adj1_stem1_pred=_tempting_a_rel
			...

MISCELLANEOUS----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because my self-worth is tied to my coverage %, added the following words that weren't being covered by the current system in order to maintain coverage after losing so many affixes.
	-kaita [nothing] - common-noun
	-haivu [already] - time-modifier adverb
	-hunaman [there ] - location-modifier adverb
	-ta [but] - clause-modifier adverb
	
	And a few others:
	
		adv1_name=clause_modifier
			adv1_stem1_orth=ket
			adv1_stem1_pred=_also_a_rel
			adv1_stem2_orth=si
			adv1_stem2_pred=_very_a_rel
			adv1_stem3_orth=ta
			adv1_stem3_pred=_but_a_rel
		  adv1_type=manner
		  adv2_name=location_modifier
			adv2_stem1_orth=aman
			adv2_stem1_pred=_there_a_rel
			adv2_stem2_orth=hunaman
			adv2_stem2_pred=_there_a_rel
		  adv2_type=loc
		  adv3_name=time_modifier
			adv3_stem1_orth=ian
			adv3_stem1_pred=_now_a_rel
			adv3_stem2_orth=veha

		  adv4_name=how_or_shall_modifier
			adv4_stem1_orth=haisa
			adv4_stem1_pred=_how_or_shall_a_rel
		  adv4_inter=on
		  
With these changes, the following IGT should parse:
Ume sontau-m haivu hapte-k
3.PL.the soldier-PL already stand.up-PST.PRF
"The soldiers have already stood up."

With these change

Morphology

Note: The copy-pasted IGT in this section from the corpus is only meant to illustrate the sourcing of specific affixes and their meanings. Specific parseable IGT is marked. 

	-nounpc-10: Split the two lexical rule instances into two lexical rules:
		-comitative-noun-pc10-lrt1: This adds the "-mak" affix. Gave this the feature CASE with value COM specified on itself. 
		-directional-noun-pc10-lrt2: This adds the "-u" affix. Gave this the feature CASE with value DIR specified on itself. 
	-noun-pc16-lrt2: Removed the "-su" emphatic affix. :( 
	-noun-pc16-lrt1: Removed the "-k" PERF verb affix that had been put there by the inference system. 
	-verb-pc2: Removed "aa=" suffix. This represented a shortened version of the 3rd-sg object pronoun "apo'ik", but had been (possibly typo'd) to attach to its verb. 95% of the time, "aa=" appears in constructions like:
		13720@@@@-1@@nee aa= temai-k hakwo-sa empo weye-vae ?@@@@1@7@1.SG.NOM 3.SG.ACC= ask-PERF when-QUESTION 2.SG.NOM go (sg. subj.)-PROSP ? // ‎‎"I asked him, 'When are you leaving?'"@@
	-verb-pc4: Added directed mood and object-adding valence-changing operation.
		Adds _direct_rel to the front of the complements list. 
	-verb-pc6: Removed "machi", which is a (probably compound verb) that appeared once in the corpus:
		7900@@@@-1@@echo sewa-m , si'ime-ta huna'a veha pua-ka aa= bwa'e uu hente , vato'o-raa , poloove-m , kaita bwa'e-machi-kai .@@@@1@19@cardon cactus flower-PL , all-ACC that.one then pick.crops-PPL 3.SG.ACC= eat DET people , in.baptism-collective , poor-PL , nothing eat-appear-ppl . // Flowers of the cardon cactus.

	-verb-pc18: Added "desid" mood to the lrt with affix "ii'aa". 
	-verb-pc19: Removed this class. It contained only "-tu", the  affix attaching to predicate nouns to indicate that the subject was becoming the noun predicate. 
	-verb-pc20: Removed "-wa" passivization affix. 
	-verb-pc31: Added "ev" mood to lrt-1, in accordance with gloss of "e'-" as "EV" affix.Source:

	-verb-47: Removed class. This class added "-m" (the plural marker) to copula NPs. 
	-verb-pc3: Removed redundant "-k" affixation rule. This is handled by verb-pc10. 
	-verb-pc11: Removed verb-pc11. This had the "am=" affix, a shortened object pronoun affix that was likely the result of a typo. The vast majority of "am=" occuring in the dataset has a space between it and the following verb, with one instance having it attached to the verb proper. Source:

	-verb-pc12: Removed future tense verb pc, as affix was moved to verb-pc10 (the tense-marking verb position class.)
	-verb-pc54: Removed "-tu" verb class, representing the "BECOME" operation on noun predicates. 
	-verb-pc57: Removed - affix "-le" only appears as an affix on adjectives in the corpus. Instead, added adjective affixes. Source:

	-verb-pc48: Removed class, which contained passive affix "-wa" and "-ka", which is a PPL affix handled elsewhere in the grammar. 
	-verb-pc10 : Added future-marking affix "-ne" and present-tense-marking empty affix (to default non-affixed verbs to present tense.) Verbs without affixes in Hiaki default to present tense.

	-verb-pc14-lrt2: Removed -ri "Nominalizer" affix, as Grammar Matrix is currently unable to handle NMLZR. 
		-Added "incep" case to "hapte" affix. I surmise its use in the following is actually some kind of compound verb, as this is actually the verb "start", rather than an affix.

====================================================================================
3.


 From the last week:
	For the testsuite:
		1. 89.2% coverage this week, compared to 94.6 from last week. 
		Two sentences were culpable:
			-"Aa huuve-wa siika". The model is currently unable to produce valid readings for "siika", because it is already inflected for case. The obligatory verb lexical rule that adds "-k" past particle to the end of a verb produces the ungrammatical "siika-k". Will fix this next week. 
			-"Uu yo'o hoote." I suspect this sentence is actually incorrect: "hoote" only takes plural subjects, according to the textbook, and "uu yo'o" is singular. Will fix in the testsuite next week. 
		2. 2.7 distinct analyses on average, compared to 4.7 last week.
		3. 12 max parses, for "Peo toro-ta hinu into toro-ta nenka".
		4. No new sources of ambiguity - ambiguity was down across the board. 
	For the corpus:
		1. 213.2% of the sentences parsed, compared to 12.6% a week ago - 292 vs 281. 
		2. 6.65 distinct analyses on average, compared to 4.23 last week.
		3. 176 max parses, on "Santos maria-ta hi'ivo'o-ria".
		4. A few new sources of ambiguity:
			-Addition of adverbs for common adverbs, such as hunaman ["there"] and ian ["now"] have caused sentences containing many of these adverbs to have many parses, due to the lack of restrictions on adverbial modification. A sentence of the form
				ADV VP ADV
				can be interpreted as 
				((ADV VP) ADV) 
				or
				(ADV (VP ADV))
			-The same can be applied to adjectives, like "huevena" ["many"]. Should probably change adjectives to modify following nouns - need more data on this front. 
			-Nouns seem to be taking S/VPs as complements via the non-event-subj-head-phrase rule (where did this come from?), leading to ambiguity in cases where a verb and a noun share orthography. Though I've tried to remove most noun predicates being interpreted as verbs, "asoa" can mean both "to give birth" as well as "child", leading to compound - vs - sentential-complement ambiguity. 
			-For the sentence "Hoan maria-ta munim bwasa-ria-k", getting some ambiguity arising from EX-ADJ on the final verbal predicate. It seems like LKB is assuming some kind of extracted wh-adjective? (Not sure where else an adjective would appear in the grammar)
