1. Yes, you may share this with future students working on the AGGREGATION project.
2. We took the choice file and input into the grammat matrix customizing engine. There were no significant causes of error, so the matrix was downloaded without modifying any of the choices. Once downloaded, the lexicon contained "%" characters that the lkb was unable to parse. These were replaced with the empty string. Additionally, within the VM, we needed to run "~/.bash_profile", which included the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable, to make sure that LD_LIBRARY_PATH was defined within the shell. Once this was done, we were able to use the program as expected.
3. 
	1. 2355 items parsed out of 2355.
	2. 32.23 was the average number of parses per item. 
	3. 672 readings were found for "uusi-tu-k in achai ayam nee ya'a-ria-k." [sentence 9500]
	4. Yaqui has free word order, with an optional subject. We can highlight a few ambiguities that arise from this:
		-SUBJ-HEAD and HEAD-COMP rules can both apply to an S. There are object markers that should resolve ambiguities in most cases, but -
		-Grammar does not have a lexical entry corresponding to the coordination word "into"/"intok", and instead allows the creation of a CONJP from any two side-by-side NPs. 
		-Currently, the grammar doesn't carry over object-marker constraints to coordinated objects. (The marker -ta that should carry over to both conjuncts of a CONJP is not forced to appear on the first argument, in our current grammar.)
		-The marker "in", corresponding to the determiner "my", is allowed to appear on either side of an NP that it serves as the determiner of. When it appears between two NPs, our as-is grammar states that it can be the daughter of either NP. 
		
		In actuality, these possessives should only occur at the start of an NP, and should replace any determiner.
